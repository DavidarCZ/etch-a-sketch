# Odin Project - Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of the Odin Project's curriculum.

It is meant to showcase mostly my use of DOM manipulation and use of event listeners.

It is simplified version of Etch-A-Sketch children's game. You can choose a grid between 1 and 100, and start drawing.
